### Classes

- class is a prototype from which objects are created and objects are instances of a class
- constructor is used during instantiation an object. The task is to initialize the data members of the class when an object of the class is created
- self represents the instance of that class and can access the attributes and methods of that class
- Getters and Setters are often used to add validation logic around getting and setting a value and To avoid direct access of a class field

### Pointers

- Pointers are variables that stores the memory address of other variables or objects
- copy by value makes a copy of the value of the assigned variables
- copy by reference doesn't make a copy of the value of the assigned variables, but instead will make a reference to that variable data
- Garbage collection is a release of memory when the objects are no longer in use where users don't have to preallocate or deallocate memory and is done automatically
